Here are some steps you can take to verify its validity and functionality:


Syntax Check: You can perform a syntax check using the bash -n command to ensure there are no syntax errors in the script.

bash -n your_script.sh


Dry Run: You can execute the script with the -n or --dry-run option, which typically performs a dry run without actually executing the commands. This can help identify any potential issues without making actual changes to the system.


Test Environment: Create a test environment similar to your production environment and execute the script to observe its behavior and verify that it performs the desired actions correctly.


Manual Review: Carefully review each function and command in the script to ensure they are appropriate for your environment and requirements.


Error Handling: Verify that the script's error handling mechanisms work as expected by intentionally causing errors and observing how they are handled.


Logging: Check the log file (/var/log/server_setup.log) generated by the script to ensure that logs are being captured correctly and contain relevant information.


Functional Testing: Execute the script on a test server and verify that the server is properly configured according to your expectations.


Edge Cases: Test the script with different Linux distributions, configurations, and edge cases to ensure it behaves as expected in various scenarios.
